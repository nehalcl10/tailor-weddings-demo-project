# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

This is the project-genesis monorepo platform — a production-ready starting point for full-stack web applications using a Next.js 16 frontend + Express 5 backend, connected via oRPC for end-to-end type-safe RPC. It uses pnpm workspaces + TurboRepo and provides the foundational architecture, engineering conventions, shared packages, and CI/CD pipeline that new projects extend with domain-specific features.

## Skill Triggers (mandatory)

**Before** editing files in this repo, invoke the matching project skill via the `Skill` tool. Project skills take priority over generic plugin skills (e.g. `incremental-implementation`, `frontend-ui-engineering`, `api-and-interface-design`) when both could apply — they encode required steps that are easy to miss.

**Examples in the table below are illustrative, not exhaustive.** The path rule wins over the example list. If the file lives in the listed directory and isn't pure text/config, invoke the skill — even if the work (utility, monitoring, integration, error tracking, etc.) isn't one of the named examples.

**Many tasks need multiple skills at once.** Integrating a new service (Sentry, Rollbar, Stripe, etc.) typically needs `cl-adding-environment-variable` + `cl-backend-patterns` and/or `cl-frontend-patterns` + any service-specific plugin skill (`sentry:sentry-sdk-setup`, etc.). Invoke all that apply; don't stop at the first match.

| If the task touches… | Invoke skill |
|---|---|
| Any new or renamed env var, or any file under `apps/*/src/utils/env.ts` / `.env.example` | `cl-adding-environment-variable` |
| Any file in `apps/server/src/email/`, or adding a new transactional email | `cl-adding-email-template` |
| **Any file under `apps/server/`** (e.g. controllers, services, oRPC handlers, Drizzle entities, migrations, jobs, utilities, monitoring, error tracking, integrations) | `cl-backend-patterns` |
| **Any file under `apps/web/`** (e.g. pages, components, hooks, forms, routes, oRPC client calls, providers, error boundaries, utilities, client-side monitoring) | `cl-frontend-patterns` |
| Any file under `packages/ui/` OR any mobile/responsive work anywhere in `apps/web/` (components, design tokens, styles, theme, breakpoints, viewport behavior, touch targets) | `cl-design-agent` |
| Any file under `packages/shared/` (Zod schemas, validation logic, shared types, error shapes) | `cl-error-handling` |
| First-time setup, onboarding, deploy config (Render + Vercel) | `cl-setup` |

Skip invocation only for trivial reads (answering questions about existing code without editing). When in doubt, invoke the skill — the cost is small and the cost of skipping a required step is large. See `## Skills Reference` further down for what each skill contains.

## Development

```bash
pnpm infra:up           # Start local infra (PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO) — required before dev
pnpm dev                # Start both web (port 3001) and server (port 3000)
pnpm dev:web            # Next.js only
pnpm dev:server         # Express only
pnpm infra:down         # Stop local infra (data is preserved)
```

### Database

```bash
pnpm db:push            # Push Drizzle schema to database
pnpm db:generate        # Generate migration files
pnpm db:migrate         # Run pending migrations
pnpm db:studio          # Open Drizzle Studio GUI
```

## Build & Tooling

```bash
pnpm build              # Build all packages (turbo)
pnpm check-types        # TypeScript type checking
pnpm check              # Biome lint + format (auto-fixes with --write)
pnpm ui:add <component> # Add a shadcn/ui component (web, packages/ui)
pnpm ui:add:mobile <component> # Add a react-native-reusables component (apps/mobile)
```

No automated deployment pipeline is configured yet. Build output is verified via `pnpm build` in CI.

## Verification

Always run these before considering work complete:

```bash
pnpm check-types        # Must pass — catches type errors across the monorepo
pnpm check              # Must pass — Biome lint + format (auto-fixes via --write)
pnpm build              # Must pass — ensures all packages compile
pnpm test:server:unit   # Must pass — server unit tests
pnpm test:server:integration  # Must pass — server integration tests (auto-starts test DB, requires TEST_DATABASE_URL)
```

### Code coverage gate

Coverage is compulsory and may never regress. Two layers enforce it:

1. **Vitest thresholds (hard floor, fork-proof).** `coverage.thresholds` in `apps/server/vitest.unit.config.ts` and `apps/web/vitest.config.ts` fail the test run when coverage drops below the pinned baseline. This needs no external service or token, so it holds in every fork. Current floors — server unit: statements 34 / branches 45 / functions 24 / lines 33; web: statements 18 / branches 16 / functions 11 / lines 18. These were reset in GENESIS-191 when honest `coverage.include` was added: the denominator expanded to all of `src/` (previously the V8 provider counted only files a test imported), so the percentages dropped while the set of covered lines was unchanged — a measurement fix, not a coverage regression. **Ratchet up, never down** from this reset baseline: when coverage improves, raise these numbers in the same PR; never lower them. The integration suite has no standalone threshold (it targets controller+DB paths, so its isolated number is not a meaningful whole-app gate); it still runs with `--coverage` so its data feeds Codecov.
2. **Codecov (relative non-regression, when `CODECOV_TOKEN` is set).** `codecov.yml` `status.project: target: auto` blocks any drop versus the base commit beyond a 0.5% jitter buffer (v8 line counting is not perfectly deterministic run-to-run); `status.patch: target: 80%` holds new/changed lines in a PR to a fixed 80% bar. Patch is pinned (not `auto`) on purpose: `auto` grades new code against the overall project number, which the GENESIS-191 baseline reset collapsed to ~34/19% — so `auto` would let a large untested module through. A fixed target keeps new code to a standard independent of the legacy baseline while the project floor ratchets up. Make these required status checks in branch protection for hard enforcement.

A `pre-push` hook validates the branch name first (cheap, always runs — `main`/`develop` and `dependabot/*`, `release/*`, `hotfix/*` branches skip the name check but still test), then runs the threshold-gated server-unit + web suites locally (integration skipped — needs the test DB). For WIP pushes, `SKIP_COVERAGE=1 git push` runs the same suites without the coverage threshold gate (tests still run and must pass; only the threshold check is skipped) — the branch-name check is never skipped, and CI + Codecov remain the hard floor. Bypass the whole hook with `git push --no-verify`.

## Architecture

### Monorepo Layout

- **apps/server/** — Express 5 API server. Entry: `src/index.ts`. Uses Clerk auth middleware, Pino logging, serves oRPC at `/rpc` and OpenAPI docs at `/api-reference` (dev only). Contains oRPC handlers (`src/orpc/`), Drizzle ORM database layer (`src/db/`), and email service (`src/email/`). `protectedProcedure` (requires Clerk auth, auto-inserts user to DB if not exists). Drizzle config at `drizzle.config.ts`.
- **apps/web/** — Next.js 16 (App Router) frontend. Uses React 19 compiler, Clerk for auth, TanStack Query for data fetching, oRPC client for typed API calls.
- **apps/mobile/** — Expo (React Native, SDK 56) app using Expo Router. **Targets iOS and Android only, no web target** (web is `apps/web`). Reuses the shared data/auth layer: `@repo/shared` schemas, `@repo/orpc-contracts`, the oRPC client + TanStack Query (`src/utils/orpc.ts`, mirroring web), Clerk via `@clerk/expo` (token via `getClerkInstance()`, persisted in `expo-secure-store`). Env is `EXPO_PUBLIC_`-prefixed (`src/utils/env.ts`). Pins react/react-dom/react-native to Expo's exact versions (opts out of the workspace catalog; react-dom is needed at runtime by transitive deps, not for web). Navigation chrome and interactive controls are **native** (NativeTabs + native stack headers; Button/Switch are SwiftUI on iOS, Material 3 Compose on Android via `@expo/ui`). Presentation styling is **Uniwind + Tailwind v4**: `className` works directly on `react-native` components (third-party ones need `withUniwind`), with design tokens in `src/global.css` (`@variant light`/`dark` blocks) seeded from the web `packages/ui` tokens. Presentation components come from **react-native-reusables** (uniwind registry) via `pnpm ui:add:mobile <component>` into `src/components/ui/` — see `apps/mobile/CLAUDE.md` for the native UI strategy. `@repo/ui` itself is web-only and is NOT consumed here. Run with `pnpm dev:mobile` (needs a simulator/device + the server running).
- **packages/orpc-contracts/** — Contract-first oRPC definitions. Defines the API surface (input/output schemas) shared between server and client. Contracts reference Zod schemas from `@repo/shared`.
- **packages/shared/** — Single source of truth for all Zod schemas and types (`src/models/`). Used by contracts, server, and client. Exports user schemas (`UserSchema`, `UserPreferences`), email schemas (`InviteEmailInputSchema`, `InviteEmailSendResultSchema`), email template types (`EmailTemplates`, `EmailTemplateName`, `EmailTemplateData`), and their inferred types.
- **packages/ui/** — Component library using `@base-ui/react` primitives (added via shadcn CLI) with custom design system (CSS variables, light/dark themes). Exports components, hooks, styles, and PostCSS config.
- **tsconfig.base.json** (root) — Shared TypeScript config extended by all packages and apps.
- Each app has its own env validation in `src/env.ts` (server uses `@t3-oss/env-core`, web uses `@t3-oss/env-nextjs`).

### Key Patterns

- **Contract-first oRPC**: Contracts in `packages/orpc-contracts` define the API surface with input/output Zod schemas. Server implements contracts via `@orpc/server`. Client consumes contracts via `@orpc/client`. Both share type-safe schemas without coupling.
- **End-to-end type safety**: Zod schemas (`packages/shared`) → oRPC contracts (`packages/orpc-contracts`) → server handlers (`apps/server`) → client (`apps/web`). The web app imports contract types for full autocomplete.
- **Auth flow**: Clerk handles auth on both sides. The oRPC client (`apps/web/src/utils/orpc.ts`) attaches JWT tokens. The server validates via Clerk middleware.
- **User sync**: `protectedProcedure` in `apps/server/src/orpc/procedures.ts` auto-inserts the Clerk user into the PostgreSQL `users` table on first authenticated request (insert with `onConflictDoNothing` — existing users are not updated).
- **Environment variables**: Validated at startup via `src/env.ts` in each app (t3-env + Zod). See the Environment Variables section below for full details.
- **Error tracking**: Rollbar is integrated on both server and client. Server-side: `apps/server/src/utils/rollbar.ts` exports an always-created `rollbar` instance (`enabled: false` when no token). Client-side: `@rollbar/react` Provider wraps the app in `apps/web/src/providers/providers.tsx`, auto-tracking the Clerk user. Both are disabled gracefully when tokens are absent.

### Frontend Routes

Public: `/`, `/sign-in/*`, `/sign-up/*`. Protected (under `portal/`): dashboard, profile, about, and design system showcase pages (colors, typography, components, email).

## Git Workflow

### Permanent Branches

| Branch | Deploys to | Purpose |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| `develop` | Staging | Default branch. All active development flows here. |
| `main` | Production | Stable, released code only. Never committed to directly. |

During MVP, only the staging environment (the `develop` branch) is deployed. `main` is dormant.

### Branch Naming

Day-to-day branches use a flat format enforced by the pre-push hook:

Format: `<prefix>-<issue-number>-<short-description>`
Pattern: `^[a-z]+-[0-9]+-[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`

Examples: `genesis-254-issue-lifecycle-labels`, `genesis-256-portal-sidebar-autoclose`

- All lowercase, hyphen-separated, no slashes
- Must start with a prefix, then the GitHub issue number, then a description
- Tickets live on GitHub Issues (the Notion board is historical). Create the issue first; the branch number is the issue number. An issue labeled `planning`, `dev-in-progress`, or `in-review` is already claimed — skip it. Pushing the branch applies `dev-in-progress` automatically via `issue-lifecycle.yml`; the apollo pipeline may later swap it to `planning`, which still means claimed

The hook also allows `release/*`, `hotfix/*`, and `dependabot/*` branches to bypass the pattern check.

### Day-to-Day Flow

```
develop
  └── genesis-42-user-invites   ← branch off develop
        └── (work, commit, push)
        └── open PR → develop
        └── CI checks pass + 1 approval
        └── merge → develop

For MVP (skip release branch):
develop → open PR → main        ← production release
```

### Hotfix Flow

```
main
  └── hotfix/critical-bug    ← branch off main
        └── (fix)
        └── merge → main     ← immediate fix
        └── merge → develop  ← keep in sync
```

### PR Titles

Must follow Conventional Commits format: `type(scope): message`. Validated by CI (`pr-title.yml`). Use the branch's issue reference as the scope (e.g. `ci(genesis-254): auto-adjust issue lifecycle labels`), and link the issue in the PR body with a closing keyword (`Closes #254`) so the lifecycle labels auto-adjust.

### CI Requirements

All PRs must pass before merge:

| Workflow | What it checks |
|----------|---------------|
| `build.yml` | Full monorepo build (server + web) |
| `server-tests.yml` | Server unit tests + integration tests (PostgreSQL service) |
| `web-tests.yml` | Frontend unit tests |
| `lint.yml` | TypeScript types + Biome lint/format |
| `pr-title.yml` | PR title follows Conventional Commits format |
| `mobile-tests.yml` | Mobile type-check + bundle export (path-filtered to `apps/mobile`) |

**Post-merge (not a PR gate):**

| Workflow | What it checks |
|----------|---------------|
| `mobile-e2e.yml` | Maestro E2E on EAS — runs on **push to `develop`**, **non-blocking/informational** (not a required PR check). See `docs/engineering/mobile-cicd-pipeline-design.md`. |

### Security Scanning

- **Dependabot** — Automated weekly PRs for dependency updates (`.github/dependabot.yml`). Groups minor/patch updates to reduce noise. Also covers GitHub Actions versions.
- **Socket.dev** — GitHub App for PR-level supply chain analysis (`socket.yml`). Detects typosquatting, malicious install scripts, network access, obfuscated code in new/updated dependencies.

## Code Style

- **Biome** for linting and formatting (not ESLint/Prettier). Tab indentation, double quotes.
- **Commit messages**: Conventional Commits enforced by commitlint + husky. Format: `type(scope): message`. Scope is required (lowercase). Max 100 chars. Allowed types: feat, fix, chore, refactor, docs, ci, build, test, perf, style, revert.
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode everywhere. `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters` enabled. ESNext target with bundler module resolution.
- **Pre-commit hook**: Runs Biome check on staged files via lint-staged.
- **Pre-push hook**: Validates branch naming conventions.

## Code comments

First focus is always making code simple and readable. Comments are a last resort, not a substitute for clarity: comments rot, drift from the code, and signal that the code itself failed to communicate.

**How to apply:**

1. Before writing a comment, try to fix the code instead: rename for intent, extract a well-named helper, simplify control flow, replace magic numbers with named constants.
2. Only add a comment when, after simplification, the code still has a non-obvious WHY: a hidden constraint, a workaround for a specific bug, a subtle invariant, or behavior that would genuinely surprise a careful reader.
3. Never explain WHAT the code does; identifiers already do that.
4. Skip boilerplate docstrings, section banners, ticket refs, and "used by X" notes. They belong in PR descriptions, not the code.
5. If a comment is needed to explain a function, that is a signal to rewrite the function, not to keep the comment.

**Comment style:** In C-style languages (JS/TS/TSX, CSS), multi-line comments always use a JSDoc-style block (`/** ... */` with leading `*` on each line), and single-line comments stay as `//`; only switch to the block form when the comment needs more than one line. In `#`-comment languages (shell, YAML), there is no block form: every line is a `#` line comment, single- or multi-line.

**Simplicity does not mean dropping correctness.** If a branch, guard, or check exists because of a real case (null input, race, boundary value, failure mode), preserve that behavior when simplifying. Removing logic is only safe when the case it covered cannot occur. When in doubt, keep the check and simplify around it.

## Key Config Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `turbo.json` | TurboRepo pipeline — caching, task dependencies |
| `pnpm-workspace.yaml` | pnpm workspace package definitions |
| `tsconfig.base.json` | Shared TypeScript config (strict mode) |
| `biome.json` | Linting + formatting (tab indentation, double quotes) |
| `commitlint.config.js` | Conventional Commits enforcement |
| `.lintstagedrc.mjs` | Pre-commit staged file checks |
| `apps/server/drizzle.config.ts` | Drizzle ORM database config |

## Environment Variables

Validated at startup via `src/env.ts` in each app (t3-env + Zod). Never read/write `.env` files directly — always go through the validated `env.ts`.

**Server** (`apps/server/src/utils/env.ts`):
- Required: `DATABASE_URL`, `CORS_ORIGIN` (comma-separated list of full browser origin URLs, e.g. `http://localhost:3001` or `https://app.example.com,https://admin.example.com`), `CLERK_SECRET_KEY`, `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
- Optional: `PORT` (defaults to `3000`), `REDIS_URL` (BullMQ worker connection), `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` (email service), `S3_ENDPOINT`, `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` (public URL clients use to reach storage; presigned GET URLs are signed against this host: set to your LAN MinIO URL when testing from a phone or any client not on the server host; defaults to `S3_ENDPOINT`), `S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (S3-compatible storage), `S3_REGION` (defaults to `"us-east-1"`), `S3_BUCKET` (defaults to `"file-uploads"`), `DB_POOL_MAX` (PostgreSQL connection pool size, defaults to `20`), `NODE_ENV` (defaults to `"development"`), `LOG_LEVEL` (defaults to `"info"`), `ROLLBAR_SERVER_TOKEN` (error tracking)

**Web** (`apps/web/src/utils/env.ts`) — all prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`:
- Required: `NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL`
- Optional: `NEXT_PUBLIC_ROLLBAR_CLIENT_TOKEN`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_MIXPANEL_TOKEN` (Mixpanel product analytics + session replay; leave unset to disable), `NEXT_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV` (defaults to `"development"`)

**Mobile** (`apps/mobile/src/utils/env.ts`) — all prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_` (Expo inlines these into the bundle at build time):
- Required: `EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL` (use a LAN IP on a physical device, not `localhost`), `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (same value as the web app's)
- Optional: `EXPO_PUBLIC_NODE_ENV` (defaults to `"development"`)

When adding a new environment variable, update ALL applicable locations:

### Server-side variables

1. `apps/server/src/utils/env.ts` — add to the t3-env schema (required or optional)
2. `apps/server/.env.example` — add example value for other developers
3. This CLAUDE.md section — keep the list above current

### Client-side variables (prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`)

1. `apps/web/src/utils/env.ts` — add to the t3-env schema (required or optional)
2. `apps/web/.env.example` — add example value for other developers
3. This CLAUDE.md section — keep the list above current

### Mobile variables (prefixed with `EXPO_PUBLIC_`)

1. `apps/mobile/src/utils/env.ts` — add to the `@t3-oss/env-core` schema (`client` + `runtimeEnv`)
2. `apps/mobile/.env.example` — add example value for other developers
3. This CLAUDE.md section — keep the list above current

## Engineering Practices

> The following engineering practices are the standard for all new code. Existing code may not yet conform — when you touch a file that violates these patterns, fix the non-conforming code in that file as part of your change.

- **Backend patterns:** Use `/cl-backend-patterns` skill for controller, service, and database entity conventions
- **Frontend patterns:** Use `/cl-frontend-patterns` skill for component organization, state management, container/presentation
- **Error handling:** Use `/cl-error-handling` skill for ORPCError usage and validation flow
- **Design system:** Use `/cl-design-agent` skill for UI consistency

## Authorization (RBAC)

End-to-end role-based access layered across edge middleware, route config, sidebar filter, and component-level gates. Roles live in `packages/shared/src/models/user.types.ts` — always use the `Roles.ADMIN` / `Roles.MEMBER` constants, never raw `"admin"` / `"member"` strings.

### Adding a role-restricted portal route

1. **Page** — create `apps/web/src/app/portal/<name>/page.tsx`
2. **Config** — add an entry to `routeAccessConfig` in `apps/web/src/config/route-access.ts`:
   ```ts
   "/portal/<name>": { allowedRoles: [Roles.ADMIN] },
   ```
3. **Nav** — add the entry to `navigationItems` in `apps/web/src/config/navigation-items.tsx` (single source of truth for both the sidebar and breadcrumb labels)

The route guard (`PortalRoleGuard`) and the sidebar filter (`filterNavItemsByRole`) both read `routeAccessConfig` — one source of truth, no drift between "this route redirects X role" and "this nav item is hidden for X role." Routes not listed in the config default to "any authenticated user."

### Component-level gating

Wrap any subtree in `<Authorizer allowedRoles={[Roles.ADMIN]}>` from `apps/web/src/components/authorizer.tsx`. Loading → renders nothing; unauthorized → renders the optional `fallback` prop (defaults to null). Authorizer never redirects — it only hides UI. For full-page gating, use a route entry instead.

### Backend procedures

Compose `requireRole` on `protectedProcedure`:

```ts
import { Roles } from "@repo/shared";
import { requireRole } from "../middleware";

export const adminOnly = protectedProcedure
  .use(requireRole(Roles.ADMIN))
  .handler(...);
```

`requireRole(...roles)` reads `context.dbUser.role` (loaded once in `protectedProcedure`) — no extra DB queries. Throws `ORPCError("FORBIDDEN")` on role mismatch. Variadic, so `requireRole(Roles.ADMIN, Roles.MEMBER)` accepts either.

## Gotchas

- **Terminology**: Never refer to Genesis as a "boilerplate". It is a **platform**. Use "platform" in all user-facing communication, docs, PRs, and commit messages.
- **Date utilities**: Use `date-fns` (v4) for all date formatting, parsing, and manipulation. Do not use `moment`, `dayjs`, or raw `Date` methods for formatting/parsing.
- **New dependencies**: Do not add a new dependency without first confirming the requirement cannot be met by an existing dependency or a built-in Node.js API. When a new dependency is genuinely needed, explain the justification before installing. (Supply chain hardening — minimizes attack surface and maintenance burden.)
- **Dependency age gate**: `pnpm-workspace.yaml` sets `minimumReleaseAge: 10080` (7 days), so `pnpm install` / `pnpm add` / Dependabot will refuse package versions younger than that. Compromised npm releases are usually caught and yanked inside this window. If you legitimately need a fresher version, add the package name to a `minimumReleaseAgeExclude:` list in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` rather than removing the global setting.
- **pnpm config lives in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`**, not `package.json.pnpm`. Both `overrides` (transitive pins) and `allowBuilds` (postinstall script allowlist — explicit `true`/`false` per package) are declared there. New deps with install scripts must be added to `allowBuilds`, or pnpm will silently skip them.
- Install packages at the **workspace root** (`pnpm add <pkg>`), not inside individual apps.
- Environment variables: never read/write `.env` files directly — always go through the validated `env.ts` in each app.
- The `packages/ui` component library uses `@base-ui/react` primitives, not raw Radix — check existing components before adding new dependencies.
- Frontend env vars must be prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be available in the browser.
- oRPC errors use `ORPCError` codes (e.g., `"UNAUTHORIZED"`, `"NOT_FOUND"`), not custom error classes.
- **Forms**: Always use TanStack Form (`useForm`) with Zod schema validation for any form — never use multiple `useState` for field values, field errors, and submission state. Use `z.string().email()` for email validation, not raw regex. See `/cl-frontend-patterns` and its `references/creating-forms.md`.
- Drizzle schema column names use camelCase in TypeScript but map to snake_case in PostgreSQL.
- `protectedProcedure` auto-inserts new Clerk users into the DB but uses `onConflictDoNothing` — it will NOT update existing user records. If you need to sync changed user data, handle it separately.
- `CORS_ORIGIN` accepts a comma-separated list of full browser origin URLs (each must include the scheme, e.g. `http://localhost:3001`). Use multiple entries for forks that need a staging origin plus a preview URL. Each entry is validated as a URL at startup; bare hostnames or `*` will fail. The first entry is treated as the primary app URL and is used in transactional email links.
- Both `env.ts` files skip validation when `CI=true` (`skipValidation: process.env.CI === "true"`). CI will not catch env schema mismatches.
- **S3 storage** uses server-proxied uploads — files go through Express to S3, not directly from the browser. The `files` table stores metadata; actual bytes live in the S3 bucket.
- `forcePathStyle: true` is required on the S3 client for MinIO and Cloudflare R2 compatibility.
- All storage operations (upload, list, file URL, delete) go through oRPC. File uploads use oRPC's native `File`/`Blob` support via `oz.file()` from `@orpc/zod` — no separate Express route or multer needed. Presigned GET URLs returned to clients are signed against `S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT` (when set) so that clients not on the server's host can reach the storage endpoint. AWS SigV4 covers the host header, so the signing endpoint and the access endpoint must match.
- MinIO must be running (`pnpm infra:up` starts all services including MinIO) before using storage locally. Create the default bucket via the MinIO console at `http://localhost:9001` (login: genesis / genesis123).
- The `files` table uses soft delete (`deletedAt`). Queries must filter `WHERE deleted_at IS NULL` to exclude deleted files. The S3 object is removed on delete, but the metadata row persists.
- **Table ID convention**: All tables use a `serial` integer `id` as the primary key (better for indexing, joins, foreign keys) and a separate `uuid` column with a unique constraint for external/API references (prevents enumeration). Both are auto-generated. Use `id` for internal queries, joins, and foreign keys. Use `uuid` in API inputs/outputs — never expose the integer `id` in API responses. Apply this pattern to all new tables.
- Rollbar only receives **server-side 5xx errors** (oRPC errors with `status >= 500`). Client errors (4xx) are not reported — they're expected application behavior, not bugs.
